# Controls

This is dedicated to performing controls analysis and control design. The purpose behind this is to refresh what I know concerning controls and to branch out on what I know. The end goal here would be to apply a control system to some chaotic system. But, gotta start simple first. 

Note: This section will likely be mostly in matlab for my own convenience and sanity. Might include some simulink files too for my own benefit.
